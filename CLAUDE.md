# CLAUDE.md

AI-Based Fake Identity & Document Screening System — a border-checkpoint platform that
reads identity and travel documents, checks them against issuing standards, looks for
tampering, verifies the bearer, and returns a risk score with an auditable rationale.

Full documentation is in [docs/](docs/); start with
[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 19 + Vite — officer console |
| Backend | Java 21 on Spring Boot 4.1.1 |
| Database | MongoDB (Spring Data), GridFS for evidence images |
| Build | Maven wrapper (`backend/mvnw`) — no system Maven installed |

## Commands

Run the API. This machine has no Docker daemon and no local `mongod`, so the embedded
profile is the working default here:

```bash
cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run -Pembedded-mongo
```

With MongoDB available, use Docker and the plain run instead:

```bash
docker compose up -d mongo
```

Tests:

```bash
cd backend && ./mvnw test
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

## Architecture

Four modules plus a cross-case watchlist stage, orchestrated by `ScreeningService`. Each
returns a `ModuleResult` holding `RiskFlag`s; `RiskEngine` combines every flag into one
`RiskAssessment`.

```
upload → Module 1 OCR → Module 2 Validation → Module 3 Tampering
                                            → Module 4 Face
                                            → Watchlist / identity history
                                            → RiskEngine → Verdict
```

| Package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ocr` | Module 1. `OcrEngine` backends + `MrzParser` (ICAO 9303 TD1/TD2/TD3/MRV) |
| `validation` | Module 2. Check digits, chronology, country codes, visa terms |
| `tampering` | Module 3. `TamperingDetector` implementations (ELA, metadata, noise, copy-move) |
| `face` | Module 4. `FaceVerifier` contract + HTTP delegate |
| `watchlist` | Blacklist hits, multiple-identity and document-reuse detection |
| `risk` | Score aggregation and verdict |
| `support` | `IdentityKeys`, `NameNormaliser` — key normalisation |
| `domain` | Mongo documents and value records |

## Conventions that matter here

**Extraction and adjudication stay separate.** OCR backends only *read*. They never decide
whether a document is genuine. Every judgement is made by deterministic, explainable code
in Modules 2–4 so an officer can be told exactly which rule fired. Do not add "is this
fake?" reasoning to an `OcrEngine`.

**Never fabricate a measurement.** If a capability is not configured — no face matcher, no
OCR engine — the module reports `SKIPPED`/`FAILED` with a reason. It does not estimate a
plausible-looking number. A screening decision must not rest on an invented score. This is
why `FaceVerificationService` has no built-in fallback matcher.

**Modules never throw into the pipeline.** A module that cannot run returns
`ModuleResult.skipped(...)` or `.failed(...)` so the remaining modules still produce a
decision. `RiskEngine` then refuses to return `CLEAR` on a *failed* module — missing
evidence is not absence of evidence. A *skipped* module does not trigger this.

**Risk combines multiplicatively, not additively** (`RiskEngine`). Accumulated trivia must
never outweigh one decisive finding.

**Every `RiskFlag` carries `evidence`.** The map is what makes a finding auditable and
re-checkable months later. Populate it.

**Pluggable backends are ordered by `priority()`** and each declares its own
`isAvailable()`. Adding a backend means adding a `@Component` — no caller changes.

**Detector thresholds exist to survive real documents.** Identity documents are covered in
deliberately repeated security printing, and every naive forensic threshold fires on it.
Before loosening any guard in `tampering`, read [docs/DETECTION.md](docs/DETECTION.md) —
each one is there because it was needed.

**Name comparison goes through `NameNormaliser`.** ICAO transliteration expands characters
(`Ü`→`UE`, `ß`→`SS`); stripping diacritics alone would raise a forgery finding against
every traveller with a non-English name.

## Environment gotchas

- **Spring Boot 4 uses Jackson 3** (`tools.jackson`). There is no `com.fasterxml`
  `ObjectMapper` bean, and Jackson 2 config keys such as `write-dates-as-timestamps` fail
  at startup. Use Jackson 3 in application code; the Anthropic SDK carries its own
  Jackson 2 internally.
- **`src/test/resources/application.yml` shadows the main one** on the test classpath, so
  a broken main config can still pass tests. Verify config changes by starting the app.
- **The Bash tool needs Windows-style paths for curl `@file` arguments** (`C:/Users/...`,
  not `/c/Users/...`).

## Optional integrations

All off by default; the system runs end-to-end without any of them.

- **Claude vision OCR** (`ClaudeVisionOcrEngine`) — activates when an Anthropic credential
  is present. Model `claude-opus-5` via the official `com.anthropic:anthropic-java` SDK.
- **Face matching** (`HttpFaceVerifier`) — activates when `screening.face.service-url`
  points at a service exposing `POST /compare`.
- **Tesseract** (`TesseractOcrEngine`) — activates if the binary is on `PATH`.

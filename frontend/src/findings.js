/*
 * Officer-facing wording for machine finding codes.
 *
 * The raw code is what makes a case auditable months later, so it is never thrown away -
 * it stays visible next to the plain wording. But `DATAPAGE_MRZ_SURNAME_MISMATCH` is not
 * something a traveller can be read out at a desk, and an officer under time pressure
 * should not have to decode it. Each entry gives a short title and a sentence saying what
 * the rule actually compared, so the recommendation can be explained and challenged.
 *
 * A code with no entry falls back to a de-underscored version of itself, so adding a flag
 * in the backend never leaves a blank in the console.
